This week we recorded the Podcast at Kevin's house with our past design
intern and now newest full-time hire, Ryan Arthur. In this episode we talk about
learning with digital doodles, HAML & SASS, responsive designs, the
importance of user experience design over aesthetic design, and how to find a
design job you'll love.
