We met with Sara Chipps and Erin Kidwell to talk about <a
href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>, an organization that holds
classes and events for developers and aspiring developers. In this episode we
talk about how Girl Develop It spread across the country with sold out classes
in only 2 years. Also we discuss creating an inclusive atmosphere and what makes
a great teacher.
