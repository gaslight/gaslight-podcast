[Southwest Ohio Give Camp](http://southwestohiogivecamp.org/) is an event that
brings developers, designers, and other technologists together to work on
projects to benefit charities. In this episode I spoke with [Matt
Brewer](https://twitter.com/MattBrewer) and [Ryan
Cromwell](https://twitter.com/cromwellryan), the organizers of the event, to
learn about the origins of SWOGC and how Matt and Ryan keep it expanding each
year.
